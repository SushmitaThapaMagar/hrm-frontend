features for designing 

In bootstrap we go through : - 
- help to design the frameworks
- break point like the size of the screen

turbopack : hotredulemodel (when the changes in code , it will update and it will auto update you dont need to refresh the page)
import alias : alias allows you to create a shorthand 

WSL : windoss subsystem for linux
Linus Torvalds -- person 


gitignore : ignore the changes, files that are in gitignore helps to ignore the content in it

eslint.config.js : lint seems like the extentions of vs code like prettier
postcss.config.mis : standard of css that use tailwind

=== Difference between the nextJS and React is the file folders


layout.tsx = displays meta data



export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>)

function RootLayout({...}): This defines a functional component named RootLayout

{ children }: This is destructuring assignment. 
It extracts the children prop from the component's props

Readonly: This utility type makes the props immutable, 
meaning they cannot be modified within the component.

{ children: React.ReactNode; }: This defines the type of the props:
children: The prop is expected to be of type React.ReactNode


for now the children is page.tsx
